The corrected CSS code adds spaces around the plus and minus operators within the `calc()` function. This ensures that the calculation is performed correctly:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(50% + 20px);
  height: calc(100% - 40px);
}
```

By including these spaces, the browser accurately interprets the mathematical expression and renders the element with the expected dimensions.
